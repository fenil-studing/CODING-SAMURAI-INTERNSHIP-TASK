# Customer Churn Prediction with TensorFlow & Keras

A hands-on deep learning project that predicts whether customers will churn (leave a service) using an artificial neural network built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. This repository demonstrates data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization — all in one notebook.

## 📌 Problem
Customer churn is when users stop using a product/service. Predicting churn helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take actions to retain them.

## 📁 Repository Contents
- `customer_churn.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with complete model pipeline
- `customer_churn.csv` – Dataset used for training and evaluation
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
3. Train-test split
4. Build and compile a neural network model
5. Train the model
6. Evaluate performance using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report
7. Visualize results

## 📊 Results
The model provides performance insights on churn prediction and demonstrates a practical approach to solving binary classification problems with deep learning.

## 📌 How to Run
1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
